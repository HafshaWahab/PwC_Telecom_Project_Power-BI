# PwC_TELECOM_PROJECT_POWER-BI
PwC (PricewaterhouseCoopers) is a multinational professional services network known for providing a wide range of services in auditing, assurance, consulting, tax advisory, and business advisory. I spearheaded a transformative initiative within the PwC as a Digital Accelerator, offered by Forage, focusing on Power BI as the cornerstone of data analytics. As an enthusiastic data analyst, I meticulously navigated through intricate datasets, employing advanced Microsoft Power BI techniques to extract actionable insights and drive informed decision-making.
## Methodology:
Data Collection | Data Cleaning & organisation | Data Analysis | Conclusion

To begin the following includes the required KPIs for the first Dashboard which analyses the customer satisfaction and services provided to them.
## KPIs:
Overall customer satisfaction  |  Overall calls answered/abandoned  |  Calls by time  |  The average speed of answer  |  Agentâ€™s performance quadrant - average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered

In addition, to better understand the data, I was appointed to make another captivating dashboard describing the demographics of the customers, the main factors leading to the churning out of customers, and potential risk analysis.
